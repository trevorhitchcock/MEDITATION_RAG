Introduction to no agenda practice (1 minute)

00:02: The no agenda practice is where we intentionally create the time and the space to actively practice non
doing. This is a radical shift because we are so often driven by all of the to-dos that we have to get done. And
sometimes, when we intentionally take the time to actively be instead of do, we can feel some anxiety or worry,
or maybe even some guilt like, "Who are we to take this time?" And this is all part of the practice of learning
how to skillfully shift between doing and being. And like anything, it's a practice. So it takes time, and the skill
will develop the more frequently you practice.
